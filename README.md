# **UltraCHESS**
## A game made with Python and Pygame library

## Intro
This is a **Classic** Chess experience brought to you by @levs16 and @Yes. We tried our **best** to port the **original** experience of the Classic Chess Game using **Python**

## Aims
- **Enchance** our **experience** in Python-coding and **learn** pygame further
- **Learn** about co-working on a project with **Git & Github**
- **Make** a functional **port** for the chess game with **coding**
 
## Structure
- All pieces logic is implemented through their very own **functions** that tell the main **hinting-system** how to draw the move hints

- Board is defined through coordinates with the positions of the figures being **preloaded**

- All textures were borrowed under a free non-comercial use licence from the **internet**

- **All** UI was implemented through pygame's **built-in** drawing and collide-checking functions

- All textures and resources are **loaded** from the **"res" folder**

- ### Mind that ALL the game was made with Pygame library and Python built-in features/functions

## Outro
Our ***team*** of 2 people hopes that you would like our ***game*** and **rate** it as **much** as it deserves. **Thank you** very much for your attention to our game and your time!
